Come make music on a massive floor piano!  An Arduino-based, electronic keyboard sized for a giant that can be walked on is perfect for all ages!  Using some homemade pressure sensors, these keys detect when someone is stepping on them, allowing the Arduino to respond by playing a note.  Tired of hearing a piano?  With the press of a button, you can switch between an array of different instruments.  The piano has a full range of keys to play your favorite song.
